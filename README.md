Project Description
This repository contains the data and source code used in the research titled "An Analysis of the Role of Face Recognition Technology in Shaping Disciplinary Behavior." The study explores the impact of facial recognition technology on enhancing employee work discipline through a reward and punishment system. The data used in this research was collected through surveys conducted among teachers at various vocational high schools (SMKs) in Central Java. The analysis was carried out using multiple linear regression and ANOVA methods to evaluate the relationships between facial recognition technology, reward and punishment systems, and the moderating effects of data security and work rules on employee discipline.
